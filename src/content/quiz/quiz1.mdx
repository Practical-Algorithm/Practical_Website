Plain explanation can be written as a plain text in MDX

- Or use `-` for list
- You can add more list however you want
- Third List  

```c++
// You can also add code with ```
int fib(int n)
{
  if(n <= 1) return 1;
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
```

Btw, you can also write <Latex formula="\LaTeX" inline/>
So `x+y=5` can be written as <Latex formula="x+y=5" inline/> 

using this `<Latex formula="x+y=5" inline/>`.

You can also write latex on a new line as well with 

`<Latex formula="x+y=5"/>`
<Latex formula="x+y=5"/>
